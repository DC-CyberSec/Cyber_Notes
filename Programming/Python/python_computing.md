### 1️⃣ Python Numbers

Summary:
Python uses whole numbers and decimals referred to as Integers and Floats respectively. These let Python compute mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction and so on. Because Python is so good at mathematical operations it is the go to language for data analysis, machine learning, and other heavy computing tasks.

### ➗ Floor Division

Summary: 
Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The `//` operator is used for floor division.

Example:

7 // 3
#2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
-7 // 3
#"-3" (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)
