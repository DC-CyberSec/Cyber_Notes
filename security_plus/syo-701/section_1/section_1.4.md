# 🔑 Public Key Infrastructure

- Polices, procedures, hardware, software, or people responsible for creating, distributing, managing, storing, or revoking digital certificates
- Big endeavor
	- Lots of planning and decisions
- Associated with binding public keys to people or devices
	- In conjunction with Certificate Authority
	- Based around trust

### 🔠 Symmetric Encryption

- Single, shared key to encrypt and decrypt
- If lost you'll need another key
- Secret key algorithm
	- Shared secret
- Doesn't scale well
	- Hard to distribute
- Very fast
	- Less overhead than asymmetric
	- Often combined with asymmetric

### 🔢 Asymmetric Encryption

- Public key cryptography
	- Uses two or more mathematically related keys
- Private key
	- Do not share
	- No access
- Public key
	- Give it away
	- Anyone can access
- Private key is the only key that decrypt data encrypted with public keys
	- Can't derive private key from the public one
- Key Pair
	- Key Generation
		- Build both public and private key at the same time
		- Lots of randomizing
		- Large Prime Numbers
		- Lots of math
- Protect the private key!
- Key Escrow
	- Someone holds on to your keys
		- Third Party

	- Client-based using SSL/TLS
	- Site-to-site using IPsec

### ➕ Algorithms

- Both sides must have the same algorithms for successful encryption/decryption
- Many different ways
- Details aren't seen by end user
- Advantages and Disadvantages based on algorithm
	- Security, Speed, Complexity

### 🔑 Cryptographic Keys

- While algorithms are usually well known the keys aren't
	- Prevents reverse engineering
	- Key determines the output
	- Keep private keys private
- Keys are subject to attacks
	- Larger keys are harder to brute force
- Symmetric keys
	- 128 bit or larger are common
	- Numbers will grow larger as time goes on
- Asymmetric keys
	- Larger than symmetric
	- Complex calculations of numbers
	- 3072 bits or larger are common
- Weak keys aren't secure by themselves
	- Strengthened by hashing, then hashing again, then hashing again...
	- Called key stretching


# 💱 Key Exchange

- Important to only have keys for the person encrypting or decrypting the data
- Logistical challenge
	- How do you share the keys without transferring them in an unsafe way?
- Out-of-band key exchange
	- Not sent over the net
	- Phone, courier, in person, etc
- In-band key exchange
	- Some information must be sent over the network
	- Faster time
	- Use additional encryption (asymmetric encryption to send a symmetric key)

### 🕐 Real-time Encryption/Decryption

- Need for fast security without compromising security
- Typically done by sharing a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption
	- Client encrypts a random (symmetric) key with a server's public key
	- Server decrypts shared key and uses it to encrypt data
	- Produces the session key
- Use session keys cautiously
	- Need to be changed often (ephemeral)
	- Need to be unpredictable
- Use public and private key cryptography to create symmetric keys

# 🎛️ Obfuscation

- The process of making something unclear
	- Makes things more difficult to understand
	- Not impossible if you know what to understand
- Hide information in plain sight
	- Have to know how it was hidden

### 🖌️ Steganography

- Greek for "concealed writing"
- Hide data in images
	- Security through obscurity
- Message is invisible but still there
- Document containing the data is the cover-text
- Network-based
	- Embedded messages in TCP packets
- Image based
- Watermarking
	- Hide messages in invisible water marks
	- Yellow dots on printers
- Audio based
	- Hide information within audio file or track
- Video based
	- Can be used to hide lots of information

### 📱 Tokenization

- Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder
- Commonly used with credit card processing
	- Use temp tokens during payments
	- Attackers can't capture the card number and use it later
- Not encryption or hashing
	- No mathematical relation

### 🤿 Data Masking

- Hides some of the original data
- Protects PII and sensitive data
- Only hidden from view
	- Data can still be in storage
	- Control the view based on permissions
- Different techniques
	- Substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking, etc


# 🖊️ Hashing/Digital Signatures

### 🍳 Hashes

- Represent data as a short string of text
	- Can be called message digest or fingerprint
- One way 
	- Impossible to recover original message from the digest
- Used for storing passwords/confidentiality
- Can verify downloads (Integrity)
- Can be a digital signature
	- Authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity
- SHA256 hash
	- 256 bit/64 hexadecimal characters
- Collision
	- Hashes should be unique
	- Inputs shouldn't ever create the same hash if they do its called a collision
	- Practically probably wont happen
	- Example
		- MD5 algorithm
- Practicality
	- Verify downloaded files
		- Compare downloaded file hash with posted hash
	- Password storage
		- Instead of strong passwords store salted hashes
		- Compare during authentication
		- Actual password is not shown
- Salting
	- Random data that's added during the hashing process to a password
	- Every user gets their own random salt
		- Commonly stored with the password
	- Protects from rainbow tables
		- Rainbow tables are tables with every possible input and every possible hash associated with those inputs
	- Slows down brute forcing
	- Salting allows different hashing to be created from the same password

### 🖊️ Digital Signatures

- Prove the message was not changed (Integrity)
- Prove the source of the message (Authentication)
- Make sure the signature isn't fake (Non-repudiation)
- Signed with a private key
	- Only signed by one person
- Verify with a public key
	- Any change in the message will invalidate the signature


# ⬛ Blockchain Technology

- Distributed ledger
	- Used to keep track of transactions
- Everyone on the blockchain can manage this ledger
	- Record and replicates to anyone
- Used for anything that requires keeping track of transactions
	- Payment processing
	- Digital identification
	- Supply chain monitoring
	- Digital voting
- Process
	1. Transaction occurs
	2. Results sent to everyone
	3. Results added to a larger block of all transaction results
	4. Hash is added to the block to add integrity
	5. Copy is sent to everyone (all nodes)
	6. Transaction is complete
	7. If the transaction is later modified the hash is invalidated
	8. Everyone becomes aware of the invalid block


# 🎫 Certificates

### 📱 Digital certificate 

- Public key certificate 
	- Binds a public key with a digital signature
	- And other details about the key holder
- Digital signatures add trust 
	- PKI uses CAs for additional trust
	- Web of trust adds users for additional trust
- Certificate creation can be built into OS 
	- Microsoft Windows domain services
	- Third party options
- X.509 
	- Standard format for certificates 
- Provides details
	- Serial number
	- Version
	- Signature algorithm
	- Issuer
	- Name of cert holder
	- Public key
	- Extensions
	- Etc.

### 🌳 Root of trust  

- Everything in IT security requires trust
	- Foundational aspect
- How to build trust from unknown?
	- Have to have approval from something or someone trust worthy
- Refer to the root of trust
	- Inherently trusted component
	- Hardware, software, firmware, etc.
	- Hardware security module, Secure Enclave, Certificate Authority

### 🚁 Certificate Authority

- Basis of providing trust when visiting or interacting with unknown entities
- Can be a third party or built in
	- Can be in any browser 
	- Purchases the website certificate to make it trusted by all browsers
- Certificate authorities sign the website certificates
	- If you trust the CA you trust the website
	- Confirms certificate owner
	- Additional verification info may be required
	- Real time verification 

### ✏️ Certificate Signing Requests

- Create a key pair, then send the public key to the CA to be signed
	- Creates a CSR
- The CA validates the request
	- Confirms DNS emails and website ownership
- CA digitally signs the certificate
	- Returns it to applicant

### ⛔ Private CA's 

- You’re your own CA
	- Built in house 
	- Devices must trust the internal CA
- Needed for medium to large organizations
	- Lots of servers and privacy requirements 
- Implement as part of your overall computing strategies 

### 🤞 Self signed certificates

- Internal certificates don’t need to be signed by a public CA
	- Your company only
	- No need to purchase trust for devices that already trust you
- Built your own CA
	- Issue own certificates signed by your own CA
- Install the CA certificates on all devices
	- Now trust any certificates signed by internal CA
	- Works the same as a cert you purchases

### 🃏 Wildcard certificate 

- Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
	- Allows a certificate to support many different domains 
	- Extension of the X.509 cert
	- Lists additional identification information
- Wildcard domain
	- Certificates are based on the name of the server
	- Applies to all server names in a domain

### 🔑 Key revocation

- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
	- Maintained by CA
	- Can contain many revocations in one large file
- Many different reasons 
	- Changes all the time 
	- Revoke certificates in case of shutting down domains or attacks
- CVE-2014-0160 - April 2014
	- Heartbleed
	- OpenSSL flaw put the private key of affected web servers at risk
	- OpenSSL was patched, every web server certificate was replaced 
	- Older certs were moved to CRL

### 📎 OCSP stapling

- Online Certificate Status Protocol 
	- Provides scalability
- If the CA is responsible for responding to all client OSCP requests 
	- May not scale well
- Instead have the status verified by certificate holder 
	- Status information is stored on the certificate holder’s server 
- OCSP status is stapled into the SSL/TLS handshake 
	- Digitally signed by the CA
- Most browsers today support OSCP 
- Messages usually sent to an OSCP responder via HTTP
	- Easy to support over internet links
	- More efficient than downloading a CRL
- Some old browsers won’t support OSCP
	- Someone support but don’t do proper checks
