## 🧠 Cyber Notes

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity notes repository. This is where I organize and refine everything I’m learning as I build a strong foundation in ethical hacking and information security.

I'm currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification and using this space to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity principles, tools, and systems.
