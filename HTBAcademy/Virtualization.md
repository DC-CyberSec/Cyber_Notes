# üíª Virtualization

- An abstraction of physical computing resources. 
- Computer parts created virtually operate precisely as the physical counterpart would. 
- Main advantage is the abstraction layer between the physical resource and the virtual image.
- Used in many cloud services
- Not simulation or emulation
- Allows for flexible and demand driven distribution of hardware, software, network, and storage components to different user
- Improves efficiency on systems and allows older systems to support newer applications
- Typically distinguish between different types of virtualization (Hardware, Application, Storage, Data, Network)

### üî® Hardware Virtualization

- Refers to technologies that allow hardware components to be accessed independently of their physical form 
- Uses hypervisor software to complete this

### üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines

- Important Benefits of VMs
	1. Applications and services of a VM do not interfere with each other
	2. Complete independence of the guest system from the host system's operating system and the underlying physical hardware
	3. VMs can be moved or cloned to other systems by simple copying
	4. Hardware resources can be dynamically allocated via the hypervisor
	5. Better and more efficient utilization of existing hardware resources
	6. Shorter provisioning times for systems and applications
	7. Simplified management of virtual systems
	8. Higher availability of VMs due to independence from physical resources
