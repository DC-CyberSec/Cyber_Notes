# üíª Virtualization

- An abstraction of physical computing resources. 
- Computer parts created virtually operate precisely as the physical counterpart would. 
- Main advantage is the abstraction layer between the physical resource and the virtual image.
- Used in many cloud services
- Not simulation or emulation
- Allows for flexible and demand driven distribution of hardware, software, network, and storage components to different user
- Improves efficiency on systems and allows older systems to support newer applications
- Typically distinguish between different types of virtualization (Hardware, Application, Storage, Data, Network)

### üî® Hardware Virtualization

- Refers to technologies that allow hardware components to be accessed independently of their physical form 
- Uses hypervisor software to complete this
