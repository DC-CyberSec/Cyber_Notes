A curated collection of thoughts, insights, and best practices for becoming an effective ethical hacker and penetration tester.

## 🧩 Mental Models

- Preconceived notions must be removed before you can begin changing your way of thinking.
- Hacking requires thinking in unconventional, creative, and non-linear ways.
- **The simplest explanation is often the most probable.**
- A problem, when stripped of emotion, is just a situation.
- Asking the right questions is often harder than finding the right answer.
- Frustration is temporary — experience is permanent.
- > “The art is not to capture some flag, but the way to it.”

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

- Reference: **The Learning Pyramid**
  - Teaching and hands-on practice have the highest retention.
  - Passive learning (reading, lectures) has the lowest.
- Every penetration test is unique — there’s no single formula.
- Preparation increases both **reliability** and **efficiency**.
- Organization saves time and reduces cognitive load.

## 🗂️ Organization Tips

- **Organize notes and tools based on operating system.**
  - Example: Use folders for Linux, Windows, Active Directory, Web, etc.
  - Capture screenshots or structure references (HTB, TryHackMe, etc.)
- **Use multiple virtual machines** during onsite engagements:
  - Separate environments for Windows, Kali Linux, and custom distros.

## 🌍 Engagement Types

### 🏢 Onsite Pentesting
- Use multiple VMs to simulate different attack surfaces or OS-specific tooling.

### 🧑‍💻 Remote Pentesting
- Access via VPN into client network.
- Clients may provide VM images that require custom configuration.

---

## 🌐 Browsers & Extensions

- Browser add-ons and bookmarks are essential tools.
- Choose a browser that syncs with your cloud account (ex: Firefox or Chrome).
- Be mindful: anything in your browser could eventually be seen by a third party.

### 🔐 Password Managers
- Recommended:
  - [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)
  - [1Password](https://1password.com)

---

## 🛠️ Scripts and Tools

- **Keep your custom scripts backed up and accessible:**
  - GitHub (public or private)
  - ProtonDrive
  - Self-hosted server or encrypted USB
- Always keep your toolset and OS up-to-date.

## 📝 Note-Taking Framework

Use a 5-category system to keep your pentesting notes clean and actionable:

1. **New Information**
   - IPs, hostnames, credentials, usernames, passwords
2. **New Ideas**
   - Tips or improvements for future assessments
   - Tools: Notion, Obsidian
3. **Scan Results**
   - Nmap, Nessus, Burp, etc.
   - Tools: Ghostwriter, PwnDoc
4. **Logs**
   - Console outputs, terminal commands, responses
5. **Screenshots**
   - Tools:
     - [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) (Linux screenshot tool)
     - [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) (GIF recorder for Linux)

## 📌 Final Advice

- Document **everything** — it creates reusable intelligence.
- Organize early and revisit often.
- Treat each engagement like an evolving puzzle.
- Sharpen your mindset just as much as your technical toolkit.
